Introduction


There are so many blog articles and YouTube videos to list here, but as we start the 90-day challenge and we focus on spending around an hour a day learning something new or about DevOps, I thought it was good to get some of the high level of "what DevOps is" down to begin.

Firstly, DevOps is not a tool. You cannot buy it, it is not a software SKU or an open source GitHub repository you can download. 

It is also not a programming language, it is also not some dark art magic either.

DevOps is a way to do smarter things in Software Development. - Hold up... But if you are not a software developer should you turn away right now and not dive into this project??? No. Not at all. Stay... Because DevOps brings together a combination of software development and operations. I mentioned earlier that I was more on the VM side and that would generally fall under the Operations side of the house, but within the community, there are people with all different backgrounds where DevOps is 100% going to benefit the individual, Developers, Operations and QA Engineers all can equally learn these best practices by having a better understanding of DevOps.

DevOps is a set of practices that help to reach the goal of this movement: reducing the time between the ideation phase of a product and its release in production to the end-user or whomever it could be an internal team or customer.

Another area we will dive into in this first week is around The Agile Methodology. DevOps and Agile are widely adopted together to achieve continuous delivery of your Application.

The high-level takeaway is that a DevOps mindset or culture is about shrinking the long, drawn out software release process from potentially years to being able to drop smaller releases more frequently. The other key fundamental point to understand here is the responsibility of a DevOps engineer to break down silos between the teams I previously mentioned: Developers, Operations and QA.

From a DevOps perspective, Development, Testing and Deployment all land with the DevOps team.

The final point I will make is to make this as effective and efficient as possible we must leverage Automation.
